# SOM-FuncBlock
Educational project for my university  
It's useful for academic purposes only.

This repository contains a few implementations of SOM algorithm: 
* Sequential SOM
* SOM parallelized by vectors
* SOM parallelized by features

Algorithm was decomposed into functional blocks that are reuseable mini-algorithms.

Implemented SOM algorithm is composition of functional blocks:

This project depends on a library that is providing basic functional blocks and enviroment for running algorithms:

And it's also worth to mention the scientific paper on which this project relies heavily:
